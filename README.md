# Brian

My name is Brian Sibanda born in a small town called Chiredzi, located in the south-east of the country, Zimbabwe. I am born in a family of 4: 3 boys and 1 girl, and am the youngest of all. I had wished to be a Scientist when I grew up. During my academic days in my junior and secondary education, I enjoyed Maths and Science and this led to me pursue a career in Computer Science. I am a holder of an Honours Degree in Computer and Information Sciences from Monash University. Due to the love of Technology, this has led me to pursue a career in Robotics. During my free time, I like doing gardening, travelling, playing chess, watching sports, reading bible and spent time with my family.
